                <h2>10th Century</h2>
                <p>The earliest widely acknowledged reference to Bosnia dates from the 10th century De Administrando Imperio written by
                Byzantine emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus.</p>

                <h2>1154</h2>
                <p>Borić was the first known Ban of Bosnia as a Hungarian vassal, and progenitor of Boričević royal house.
                He was appointed by 1154, during Byzantine-Hungarian conflicts, and was last mentioned in 1163.</p>

                <h2>1180</h2>
                <p>Kulin was the Ban of Bosnia from 1180 to 1204, first as a vassal of the Byzantine Empire and then
                of the Kingdom of Hungary, although his state was de facto independent. He was one of Bosnia's most prominent and
                notable historic rulers and had a great effect on the development of early Bosnian history.</p>

                <p>The Charter of Ban Kulin was a trade agreement between
                the Banate of Bosnia and the Republic of Ragusa that effectively regulated Ragusan trade rights in Bosnia, written on 29
                August 1189. It is one of the oldest written state documents in the region.</p>

                <p>Bosnian history until the early 14th century was marked by the power struggle between the Šubić and Kotromanić
                families. This conflict came to an end in 1322, when Stjepan II Kotromanić became ban. By the time of his death in 1353,
                he had succeeded in annexing territories to the north and west, as well as Zahumlje and parts of Dalmatia.</p>

                <p>After decades of political and social instability, Bosnia officially fell to the Ottoman Empire in 1463, while resistance was active and fierce for a few more centuries. Southern regions of Bosnia, nowadays known as "Herzegovina" would follow in 1483, with a Hungarian-backed reinstated "Bosnian Kingdom" being the last to succumb in 1527.</p>

                <p>The Porte's efforts at modernizing the Ottoman state were met with great hostility in Bosnia, where local aristocrats
                stood to lose much through the proposed reforms. This, combined with frustrations over political concessions to
                nascent Christian states in the east, culminated in a revolt by Husein Gradaščević in 1831., which ultimately failed.</p>

                <p>Following World War I, Bosnia was incorporated into the South Slav kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. Political life in Bosnia at this time was marked by two major trends: social and economic unrest over the
                Agrarian Reform of 1918–19 manifested through mass colonization and property confiscation, also formation of several
                political parties that frequently changed coalitions and alliances with parties in other Yugoslav regions.</p>

                <h2>1929</h2>
                <p>The establishment of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929, however, brought the redrawing of administrative regions into
                banates that purposely avoided all historical and ethnic lines, removing any trace of a Bosnian entity.[1] Serbo-Croat
                tensions over the structuring of the Yugoslav state continued, with the concept of a separate Bosnian division receiving
                little or no consideration.</p>

                <p>The famous Cvetković-Maček agreement that created the Croatian banate in 1939 encouraged what was essentially a
                partition of Bosnia between Croatia and Serbia. However, outside political circumstances forced Yugoslav politicians
                to shift their attention to the rising threat posed by Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany. Following a period that saw attempts
                at appeasement, the joining of the Tripartite Pact, and a coup d'état, Yugoslavia was finally invaded by Germany on 6
                April 1941.</p>

                <p>On 25 November 1943 the Anti-Fascist Council of National Liberation of Yugoslavia with Tito at its helm held a founding
                conference in Jajce where Bosnia and Herzegovina was reestablished as a republic within the Yugoslavian federation in
                its Ottoman borders.</p>

                <p>The first multi-party parliamentary elections held on 18 and 25 November 1990 led to a national assembly dominated
                by three ethnically-based parties, which had formed a loose coalition to oust the communists from power. Croatia and
                Slovenia's subsequent declarations of independence and the warfare that ensued placed Bosnia and Herzegovina and its
                three constituent peoples in an awkward position. A declaration of sovereignty on 15 October 1991 was followed by a referendum for independence from Yugoslavia on 29
                February and 1 March 1992. Bosnia and Herzegovina became an independent state on 3 March 1992.</p>

                <h2>1992-1995</h2>
                <p>The killing of a Bosniak civilian woman on 5 April 1992 by a sniper, while she was demonstrating in Sarajevo against the
                raising of barricades by Bosnian Serbs, is widely regarded as marking the start of warfare between the three major
                communities. Open warfare began in Sarajevo on 6 April. In March 1994, the signing of the Washington accords between the Bosniak and ethnic-Croatian leaders led to the creation
                of a joint Bosniak-Croat Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This, along with international outrage at Serb war crimes
                and atrocities (most notably the Srebrenica genocide of as many as 8,000 Bosniak males in July 1995) helped turn the
                tide of war. The signing of the Dayton Agreement in Paris by the presidents of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Alija
                Izetbegović), Croatia (Franjo Tuđman), and Yugoslavia (Slobodan Milošević) brought a halt to the fighting, roughly
                establishing the basic structure of the present-day state. The three years of war and bloodshed had left between 90,000
                and 110,000 people killed and more than 2 million displaced.</p>

                <p>Since its 1992 independence and the 1995 Constitutional framework of the Dayton Agreement, Bosnia and Herzegovina has
                followed a path of state-building, while remaining under final international supervision through the figure of the High
                Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina. Bosnia and Herzegovina is a federation of two Entities - the Federation of
                Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Republika Srpska, as well as the district of Brčko. Each of the Entities has its own
                Constitution and extensive legislative powers.</p>
